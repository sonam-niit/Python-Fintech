First of all let's install python
-----------------------------------------
after installation check python version

>py -V

python will also provide pip with itself using that you can install packages of python.

let's check pip version too.
>pip -V

If you are getting both the versions means python installed successfully in your system.

How to Work with Python.

if you search you will get python app directly so you can double click on that and start python interpreter to run your commands.

if you want to open python in cmd then

type
>py 

and you will be inside the python interpreter.

>>> print("Hello World")
check output
>>>print(20+40)
check output

type exit() to exit from python interpreter.

Let's create first program using python

open notepad and add below mentioned code

print("Hello World");
print("Welcome Sonam Soni")
print("Bye Bye")

save it at some perticular location with some name and .py extention (first.py)

move to that folder where you have saved your file now in file url type cmd and press enter.

you will be able to open that folder from cmd

once you are in that folder execute below command
>py first.py

(check the output)

IDE(integrated Develpment Environment)

it provides some direct features to work with any programming language like create project, open project, run project.

Let's install jupyter notebook

open cmd and type 
>pip install jupyter

once it is installed open any perticular project folder where you want to store all your projects.
type below command
>jupyter notebook

you will be able to open localhost:8888 in browser where you can see jupyter notebook.

click on new to create new python script and click on file to rename the same. click on save to save all your steps which you have executed.

Comments: non executed codes are called as comments.
	--> with the help of comments you can made your code more redable
	--> developers can understand your code.

	--> comments you can add by just adding a # symbol before the line which you want to add.


Datatypes
-----------------

"Hello World" -- String (str)
 10   -- number (whole number) (int)
 20.5 -- fractional (decimal number) (float)

 1i+2j -- complex number (complex)
 ["a","b","c"] --> list
 ("a","b","c") --> tuple
 range(4) -- range

 {"name":"sonam","email":"sonam@gmail.com"} ==> key value pair (dict) --> dictionary

 {"a","b","c"}  --> set

 frozenset({"a","b","c"} ) --> frozenset

 true/false --> boolean (bool)

 b"hello" --> binary (bytes)

 None --> Nonetype
______________________________________________________________________________

Logical Opeartors

or and operators used to combine 2 or more conditions.

(a>b) and (a>c) --> and says if both the conditions are true then only returns true.

(a>b) or (a>c) --> or says if any one of the condition is true then also returns true.

Practice Task
--------------------
1. WAP to print addition of 3 numbers.
2. WAP to print Average of 3 numbers.
3. WAP to print area and perimeter of square.
	Area= side *side
	
4. WAP to print circumference and Area of circle.
5. WAP to calculate Simple Intrest(I= PRN/100)
