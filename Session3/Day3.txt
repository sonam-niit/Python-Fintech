Polymorphism
--------------------------

poly- many
morph - forms

same functionality can work in diffrent way.

function available in python--> len()

same function we can use to calculate the length of characters, calculate the no of items in list, calculate the no keys is dictionary.

Another way to use polymorphism is using Inheritance.

Inherit the functionality but we want to change the implementation.

if the child is having its own method, though parent is having the same method them child will override the parent method and call its own method. (Method overriding- Dynamic polymorphism)

Encaptulation
--------------------
Hiding the variables (properties of a class) from direct access

if outside of class you want to access them them wrap them in some method and use it.

How to hide?

we can make our class members as following:
	Public members: Access from Everywhere
	Private Members: access from its class only, not from other class, not from outside claaes
	Protected members:access from same class and its child class only.


Task:
-----------
